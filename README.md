# Use Notes

# There are many places with path locations commented out, please enter your respective path to the directory containing your bashForQIIME.sh file as well as the two C files.

# This program also requires a folder named Classifiers to be inside your bashForQIIME directory. The classifiers chosen were Silva138 for the May 2024 update of Qiime2, as well 
# as the GreenGenes515f806r and GreenGenesFullLength for the February 2024 update of Qiime2. These files may be downloaded from https://resources.qiime2.org/ and renamed accordingly.
# Of course, the code may be edited and you may use whatever classifier you desire, including one that is not pre-trained.

# Please also ensure you have installed the gcc compiler so the C programs will be able to compile and run.
